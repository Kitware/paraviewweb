<ol>
<li>the amount of <a href="">mutual information</a> (MI) between pairs of variables;</li>
<li>the <a href="">pointwise mutual information</a> (PMI) between values of one variable and another; and</li>
<li>the approximate probability distribution of each variable (for reference).</li>
</ol>
<p>The diagram consists of an annular region for each variable indicated by a field provider.<br>The angle of each annular region is proportional to the information of the corresponding variable.<br>For this reasion, variables that take on a single value are not included in the diagram – since<br>their entropy is 0.<br>The center of the diagram contains an illustration of either MI or PMI, depending on user interaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>An outer circular region used to display 1-d histogram (approximate PDF) of each variable.</li>
<li>Inside the histogram are colored annular regions that serve as a legend.<br>Each region has a text title (the variable name) and (if a LegendProvider is specified) a legend mark.<br>These bars serve as both a legend and as buttons for choosing what is displayed inside the circle they bound.</li>
<li>Inside the legend are chords that connect one variable to another:<ul>
<li>Initially, the chords show all pairwise connections between variables.<br>Each variable also has an chord connecting to itself that illustrates the self-information, or entropy,<br>of the variable.<br>The widths of all chords are proportional to the mutual information between the variables they connect<br>(across all values that either variable takes on).</li>
<li>When one of the legend marks is clicked, then only those chords associated with the corrsponding variable<br>are displayed.</li>
<li>When an chord between a pair of variables is clicked, then the inner diagram<br>switches to display chords between some bins of the 1-d histograms of the 2 variables.<br>The bins for which chords are shown correspond to those with the highest<br>absolute, finite values of PMI.<br>When an chord is green, the bins it connects co-occur more frequently than statistical independence would suggest.<br>When an chord is red, the bins it connects co-occur less frequently than statistical independence would suggest.<br>Bins that co-occur exactly as often as statistical independence would suggest are the last to be chosen for display.<br>Bins that never co-occur across the entire dataset (i.e., when values are mutually exclusive) are never connected by chords.<br>Arcs with finite, absolute PMI values above the 95-th percentile are included in the display.</li>
<li>When a 1-d histogram bin in the outer ring is clicked, the inner diagram<br>switches to display chords between that bin and some bins of all the other variables in the dataset.<br>The bins for which chords are shown correspond to those with the highest absolute, finite values of PMI.<br>Arcs with finite, absolute PMI values above the 80-th percentile are included in the display.<br>This display is similar to the one above except that it illustrates only chords attached to<br>one bin of one variable instead of chords between any pair of bins between 2 variables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Providers" class="article-heading"><a href="#Providers" class="headerlink" title="Providers"></a>Providers<a class="article-anchor" href="#Providers" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The diagram requires the data model to be<br>a field provider,<br>1-d histogram provider, and<br>a mutual information provider.<br>The mutual information provider in turn requires a data model that is a 2-d histogram provider.</p>
<p>The mutual information diagram behaves differently depending on the API provided by the data model.<br>If the data model is a</p>
<ul>
<li>legend provider, the legend will include colored glyphs in each variable’s arc;</li>
<li>histogram-bin hover provider, histogram bins (including other components sharing the same data model)<br>will be highlighted as the cursor hovers as described in this document;</li>
<li>selection provider, then double-clicking as described above will cause the active selection to<br>be changed to the relevant set of bins as described in the Interactions section.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Interactions" class="article-heading"><a href="#Interactions" class="headerlink" title="Interactions"></a>Interactions<a class="article-anchor" href="#Interactions" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2><p>The following is a list of ways users can interact with the diagram, including those mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hovering outside the inner circle will highlight the 1-d histogram bin intersecting the line between<br>the cursor position and the center of the diagram.<br>This only happens when the data model is a bin-hover provider.</li>
<li>When PMI chords are displayed,<ul>
<li>Hovering inside the inner circle will highlight the histogram bin as mentioned above <strong>plus</strong><br>bins in the corresponding variable with high PMI relative to that bin.<br>This only happens when the data model is a bin-hover provider.<br>The other exception to this rule is the following:</li>
<li>When drawing PMI chords for a single bin in 1 variable (and the most-dependent bins<br>in all other variables), hovering inside the inner circle but outside of any chords<br>will highlight (in yellow) all of the chords associated with the variable containing<br>the cursor as well as highlighting (in blue) the 1-d histogram bins in the outer ring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clicking on a MI chord will display PMI chords between the 2 corresponding variables.</li>
<li>Clicking on a 1-d histogram bin will display PMI chords between that bin and bins of other variables.<br>Double-clicking will turn the histogram bin into a range selection (if the data model is a selection provider).</li>
<li>Clicking on the legend will switch the inner circle to display MI chords or – if displaying<br>MI chords – will toggle between showing all chords and just the chords for the legend’s variable.</li>
<li>Double-clicking on a highlighted PMI chord will turn the corresponding bins (in both variables) into<br>a bivariate range selection (if the data model is a selection provider).</li>
</ul>
