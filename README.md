### Introduction

This repository is now in maintenance mode which means we are not adding any new feature.

Nowadays, the VTK/ParaView Web stack relies on [vtk.js](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/) for local and remote rendering.

If you are looking at building interactive 3D web visualizations applications, you might want to look at [trame](https://kitware.github.io/trame/) which allow any Python developer to do so with little to no knowledge in Web.

## Documentation

The [documentation](https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb) provides many guides that are still relevant for any modern VTK/ParaView Web applications based on [vtk.js](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/) or [trame](https://kitware.github.io/trame/). 

With time we hope to replace it with more up-to-date guides directly on the [trame website](https://kitware.github.io/trame/).
